Month ago I finished reading ['Soft skills' by John Z. Sonmez](http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8). So, today's post is not going to be about programming itself.
This book is about everything what surrounds programming and programmer.

This book has 7 sections on 504 pages. And each section is overview of a big field with tips and tricks. I'm goint to show some quotes
which I saved during the reading. 

## Career

This section is about career as you could notice from the section's name. The main idea is that you should treat youself as a business. That means
you sell your services to a company. If you want getting much money your services should be more specific, complex and deep.

Another important idea is:

>“how you do anything is how you do everything.” (Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, HarperCollins Publishers, 2005) If you lower your standards in one area, you’ll inadvertently find them dropping in other areas as well. Once you’ve crossed the line of compromise, it can be difficult to go back.

Totally agree with that. Of cource, sometimes, business requires less solid but much faster solutions, but it should be a rule.  

Also, this section gives advice how to quit a job and become an employee - I didn't find something special here as long as I'm
not planning to run my own business in the near future.

## Marketing youself

This is most interesting section. I thought about it but I didn't have solid opinion on this subject. It's all about self
branding. Blogging, screncasts recording, public speacing, of cource in your professional field, helps to reach career goals.
This capter proofs my ideas about the reason why I'm blogging, and it makes me blog more. 

> You see, a brand is more than just a logo. A brand is a set of expectations about a product or service. A logo is just a visual reminder of a brand.

A few more quotes from the section.

> To put it simply, the quickest way to pass an interview is to get the interviewer to like you.

And self-branding will help you make an interviver like you before the interview even if you don't know each other in person.

> I spent some time researching the company and found that some of the developers for that company maintained blogs. I started following all of the blogs of the developers who worked for that company and began putting thoughtful and relevant comments on many of their blog posts.

> The basic idea of the 10-step process is to start by getting a basic understanding of what you’re trying to learn—enough to know what you don’t know. Then take that information and use it to define the scope of what you want to learn, along with what success will look like. Armed with that knowledge, you can find resources—and not just books—to help you learn what you want to know. Finally, you can create your own learning plan to chart the course you’re going to take to learn your sub- ject and filter the materials down to just the best ones that will help you achieve your goal.

> I schedule all of these tasks by creating cards in Trello or Kanbanflow. For each card, I estimate how long it will take in pomodori (which are each 25 minutes of focused work). I assume that I can get about 10 pomodori done each day.
