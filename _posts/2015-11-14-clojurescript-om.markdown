About 2 months ago I started learning clojure. Not too actively - mostly on weekends. I wrote a post where i showed how easy is to builld a small application connected to mongo db. Today I'm going to show you how to create a real world client-side application using clojurescript.

Currently, the most progressive approach for building client side applications is react.js. That's why when somebody is talking about clojurescrit they will definitely mention om. Btw, most of videos about clojurescript on youtube mostly covers only om.

What is om
Om is a clojurescript wrapper for react.js. 

Today I'm going to create admin panel for my blog. It'll be a modern admin panel with realtime article preview like ghost blog.
