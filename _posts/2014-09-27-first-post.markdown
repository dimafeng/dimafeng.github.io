Hi, my name is [Dmitry](http://dimafeng.com/about/). I’m a professional software engineer. Here I’m going to share my thoughts on interesting subjects around programming. You’re welcome to comment my posts and let me know if there are mistakes in my posts or just to ask something - fell free to do it.

Most of the blog posts here will be about JVM related languages because I use it every and I really love it. These days, it’ s not longer enough to know only one language/platform - that’s why sometimes I write about javascript, some modern technologies or even about DevOps. I split all articles into 3 categories:

* **Regular articles** - articles about production ready technologies and technologies which I used in production;
* <img style="width: 20px;" src="/images/devops-icon.png"> **DevOps** - articles on non-programming subjects;
* <img style="width: 30px;" src="/images/hip-icon.png"> **Hipsterish** - modern and trendy stuff, or experimental.

**UPD**: 01/03/2016
