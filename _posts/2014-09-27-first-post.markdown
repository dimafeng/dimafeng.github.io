Hi, my name is Dmitry. I'm professional software engineer. Here I'm going to share my thoughts about programming. You'll be able to comment my posts and ask questions, I'll really appreciate if you'll do.

Most of blog posts here will be about JVM based technologies, because I use it every and I really love it. Also recently I became interested in client-side development using javascript and other client side tools.  I don't pretend to be a GURU of these technologies. I've got a thoughts and ideas which could be discussed with you.
