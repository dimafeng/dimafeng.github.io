This is not a complete article - it's a post with docker essential tips which you have to know if you want to run some of your apps within a docker enviroment. I'm going to update this article when I learn this system better. These are my first steps and I'll use my article as a reminder in the future.

## Docker installation

Docker still dosn't have full support in mac os. Of course they have [Boot2Docker][2], but it's docker lauched within a VM. So, I prefer to use my own VM running in VirtualBox on another machine. In order to do so, I use ubuntu. Installation on ubuntu linux looks as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
{% endhighlight %}

or you can use ubuntu repository:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
{% endhighlight %}

If you see an error like this:

{% highlight bash %}
FATA[0000] Post http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.17/images/create?fromImage=mongo%3Alatest: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory
{% endhighlight %}

you just need to reboot a server.

## Build your own container

To build you own container, you need to have `Dockerfile`. Go to the folder where your docker file is located. And execute this command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo docker build -t [name] .
{% endhighlight %}

Useful parameters:

* `-no-cache` - builds container avoiding cached steps.

## Run container

After a container building process, you can launch it. The command could be like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --link my-mongo:mongo [name]
{% endhighlight %}

Useful parameters:

* `-d` - runs container in the background
* `-p [container port]:[host port]` - opens the exposed port on an host machine
* `--link [name or id]:[alias]` - allows a container to access another container speicified by `[name or id]`
* `-v [host path]:[container path]` - for external volume linking
* `--restart="always"` - restarts your container after a failure or a system reboot
